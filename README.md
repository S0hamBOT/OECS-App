# University Finder API

A smart little API that helps students find universities they qualify for; based on GRE, IELTS, and CGPA scores. Built with Node.js + Express and a sprinkle of logic magic.

## How It Works

1. Normalize your scores to a 0â€“100 scale  
2. Calculate a weighted score:  
   `50% GRE + 30% IELTS + 20% CGPA`  
3. Match universities in your target country  
4. Return results sorted by ranking
